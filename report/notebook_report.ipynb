    "### **1.0 Assessment Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative research in finance relies heavily on the analysis of historical market data to evaluate the performance of trading strategies before live deployment. However, raw market data frequently contains **noise, missing values, and inconsistent quotes**, which can distort strategy performance if not properly handled. Moreover, naive simulations that assume **perfect trade execution** often lead to **overstated and unrealistic returns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assessment presents a **modular Python framework** developed to simulate trading activity under more realistic market conditions. The framework emphasizes **data integrity, execution realism, and analytical reproducibility**, providing a foundation for evaluating signal-driven trading strategies with statistical rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Framework Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework is composed of four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Data Validation**\n",
    "- Cleans and aligns quote and signal datasets.  \n",
    "- Detects and removes common data issues such as **inverted spreads**, **null entries**, and **extreme outliers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Signal-Based Simulation**\n",
    "- Executes trading signals using a **latency-aware fill engine**.  \n",
    "- Tracks order types (open/close), executed prices, slippage, and PnL.  \n",
    "- Incorporates **execution delay** to better reflect real-world trading latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Performance Metrics and Logging**\n",
    "- Generates detailed **execution logs** for each simulated trade.  \n",
    "- Computes essential performance metrics including:  \n",
    "  - Total trade count  \n",
    "  - Gross and Net PnL  \n",
    "  - Average trade PnL  \n",
    "  - Slippage  \n",
    "  - Maximum drawdown\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Framework Extensibility**\n",
    "- Supports flexible configuration of simulation parameters such as **latency**, **signal thresholds**, and **execution models**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Implements a **probabilistic execution model** that simulates **realistic fill uncertainty** using random draws based on **execution probability**, derived from **price aggressiveness** and the **relative bid–ask spread**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **relative spread** is calculated as the normalized difference between the best ask and bid prices, allowing the model to remain consistent across assets with different price scales.   \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 Purpose and Contribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework serves as a **lightweight yet realistic research tool** for quantitative analysts and developers.  \n",
    "It enables:\n",
    "- Rapid testing and validation of trading signals.  \n",
    "- Insight into market impact.  \n",
    "- Transparent reporting of results with reproducible performance analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating careful data validation with realistic execution modeling, the project bridges the gap between **theoretical signal research** and **practical trading implementation**.\n",
